# Page - Splash Screen - Welcome to SETTER
Good day!  My name is Cody Seibert, and I am one of the developers behind setters.  Today, I will be giving you a quick overview of how to use setter for your climbing gym.

# Page - Login Screen
First off, we are going to log in to one of our pre-existing gym accounts used by Aiguille Rock Climbing Center in Orlando FL.

# Action
    - type in email
    - type in password
    - click login

# Activity Tab
After we log in, we will be brought to our dashboard page.  On this page, there are three different tabs: activity, statistics, and climbers.  The activity tab shows information about your gym's routes & problems, in addition to the most recent climber sends.

- click on statistics tab

# Statistics Tab
Next, we will navigate to the statistics tab which displays the current routes and problems at your gym, as well as the bouldering and rope distribution.  You may export this data by clicking the export graph link found at the top right of each graph.

- click on export button
- open the pdf
- close the pdf

To add a route in SETTER, click the set route button which takes you to the manage zone page.

- Click Route Button

Here, we can find the list of zones that are currently available at your gym.

If no zones are currently available, you may add one by using the add zone widget at the top of the list

- hover over add zone widget

Additionally, you can also search through zone by using the zone filter widget.

- type out a zone name

For this example, we will add a boulder problem on the lead cave zone

- click on lead cave

Here is a list of the current routes and problems set on this zone, along with their ratings based on member feedback.

- click on Add Route

The boulder problem we will add will be a green v10 set by Mark Mercer.

- click color, select green
- click grade, select v10

This new route will appear at the bottom of the zones list.

 - Click Route Page

If you want to make changes to your route, you may do some by clicking edited route button available on the route information page.

When a route or problem is stripped from the wall, you may save it into the route archive by clicking the strip route button.

- hover mouse over strip route

Now let's navigates to the route archive page.

- click route archive


# Route Archive
On the route archive page, we can view all of the routes that have ever been at the gym.  Filters allow you filter routes by climbing type, setters, grade, route color, and zone.

We can also sort the rows by clicking the table headers.

So how would someone add a setter?

To do so, let's navigate to the manager setters page.

# Manage Setters
To add a setter, click the add setter button, search for the user you want to add, and click the plus icon next to their name.

# Finish
That concludes our quick overview. Thanks for watching! If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at setterapp@gmail.com.  You may also find us on twitter and facebook.
