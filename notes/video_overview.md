## Adding Zones
In this section of the video, we will cover how to manage your zones.  The zones on SETTER related to the walls, zones, or sections in your gym, such as a particular boulder area, or a well known rope area of your gym.

As you can see, a branch new SETTER account will not have any zones.  We first must add some zones.  Typically, you can name your zones the same as how they are found on your public gyms topo (assuming that you have a gym topo displayed for your member on your gym's website).

Too add new zones, click the "Zones" button (the second navigation icon with the map icon at the top salmon colored bar of the application).

Now that you are on the "Manage Gym Zones" page, you can start adding new zones.  To add a new zone, type in the name of your zone in the input box containing the text "New Zone Name" and finally click the "Add Zone" salmon colored button.


## Managing Your Routes

### Adding a Route
Once you have added the zones found inside your gym, you should now start adding your routes onto those zones.

To add a route into a zone, navigate to the **Manage Gym Zones** pages and click on any of the rows.  This will take you to the zone page.

Once on the zone page, you can then click the **+ Add Route** salmon colored button to navigate to the set route page.

On the set route page, there are a few options you can specify related to your route:

The **type** of the route differentiates between *bouldering*, *top rope*, or *lead*.

The **grade** dropdown allows you to select the grade of the route.  If you are still unsure of the grade, you can simply leave it as V? or 5.? and come back later.

The **setter** dropdown allows you to select the setter who set the route.  This can also be defaulted to guest if you want to come back later to fill in the correct setter or if the route was set by someone who doesn't normally set at your gym.

The **color** dropdown allows you to select the color of the route.  Currently, we support 13 pre-defined colors, and the list of colors can't be changed.  This will change in the future as needed.

The **route name** input allows you to name the route, if so inclined

The **note** input allows you to add specific notes to the routes.  For example, one note could be "all naturals are off", or maybe "the right side wall is off".  These notes will be displayed to the users.

Lastly, simply click the **Add Route** button at the bottom of the form to add the route to the zone.

### Editing a Route
Similar to the same flow as **Adding a Route** above, to edit a route, you simply navigate to the **Manage Gym Zones** page, click on the zone that contains your route, click on the route you wish to edit, and finally click on edit route.  

This edit route page is basically identical to the **Add Route** page, except for you must click on the **Save** button when you are finished making your changes.

### Stripping a Route
Over time, your routes will be stripped off of the wall.  When this happens, you can simply *strip* a route by navigating into the route page and

### Deleting a Route
To remove a route, you must navigate into the route using the same flow as mentioned in **Adding a Route**, except you now much click the on the ""

## Managing Your Setters
To manage your setters, that is, to add, remove, and view analytics on your setter, click on the **Setters** button in the top navigation bar (when full screen) or in
the side nav bar (mobile).

### Adding a Setter
Click on the **Add Setter** button near the top of the content of the setters page.  This will redirect you to a new page where you can search through the list of your home gym users to add a setter.

Notice: your gym setters **must sign up** for a setter **user account** and they must **select** your gym as their **home gym**.
