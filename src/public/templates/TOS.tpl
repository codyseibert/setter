            18.5 You agree that if the Company does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which the Company has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of the Company rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to the Company.

            18.8 Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld).
